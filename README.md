# Gun TODO list

This is a TODO list example inspired by https://github.com/thrownness/decentralized-todo-app and built with Preact + htm + hooks.
This project uses the official TODO MVC CSS [https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc-app-css]

htm provides a JSX-like syntax but it uses template literals and is used here in conjunction with Preact to avoid the build step. This project can also be easily converted to React and JSX but for the sake of simplicity I'm using the aforementioned tools.

This project also uses modern ES6+ syntax and ESM modules, so it should be run in evergreen browsers (Chrome, Edge or Firefox should all work) or transpiled (out of scope).

# Running the project

Use `pnpm`, `npm` or `yarn` to install the dependencies:

```
$ npm i
$ cd gun-preact-todoapp
$ npm start
```

Then visit [localhost:5151](http://localhost:5151) in your browser.
